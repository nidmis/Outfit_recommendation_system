# Outfit_recommendation_system

An intelligent outfit recommendation system that leverages deep learning techniques to suggest suitable clothing combinations. The system is implemented in Java and utilizes the Deeplearning4j library for building and training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on image data. The key features of the system include:

--Image Processing: Efficient loading and preprocessing of images for training the neural network.

--Deep Learning Model: A CNN architecture designed to classify and recommend outfits based on image inputs.

--Training and Evaluation: Comprehensive training routines with performance evaluation metrics to ensure accurate recommendations.

--User Interface: A graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with the system and receive outfit suggestions visually.

--By analyzing images of clothing, the system aims to provide users with smart outfit recommendations, enhancing their fashion choices through the power of artificial intelligence.
